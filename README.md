## Sessions Content

### 0 - Zero Session

Python Virtual Environments and Packaging Systems
We will evaluate and provide an example for next approaches to use python in local development, without vm (virtualization) or dockers (isolation) techniques. We will experiment with conda, pipenv, pyenv, setuptools, venv module and poetry in later sessions. Start with conda + pip


### 1 - First Session

Get Started With Python
Create a simple cli app with fire and setuptools to evaluate current virtual environments.
Use cona for simplicity of spin up with python version and venv.
vpy - analize current virtual environment. (pick on poetry code)
